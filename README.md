# biostatistics-portfolio
Welcome to my biostatistics portfolio. This repository collects projects I have completed to strengthen my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and computational biology.

## Current Projects
**- RNA-seq Pan-Cancer Clustering**

	- Unsupervised clustering applied to RNA-seq gene expression profiles to identify cancer subtypes.
	
	- https://github.com/grybkom/pancan_clustering

**- CNN for Cancer Detection**

	- Binary image classification of metastatic cancer in tissue samples using a convolutional neural network
	
	- https://github.com/grybkom/CNN_Cancer_Detection

**- Comparison of Supervised Machine Learning Models for Stroke Prediction**

	- The results from Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoosted models were comared with and without implementing synthetic minority over-sampling technique to address class imbalance.
