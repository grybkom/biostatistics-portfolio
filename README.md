<h1 align="center">Mike's Biostatistics Portfolio</h1>
Welcome to my biostatistics portfolio. This is a repository of projects I have completed and I am currently working on to strengthen my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and computational biology.

# Current Projects
## RNA-seq Pan-Cancer Clustering
- Unsupervised clustering applied to RNA-seq gene expression profiles to identify cancer subtypes.	
- https://github.com/grybkom/pancan_clustering

## Convolutional Neural Network for Alzheimer's Detection from MRI Scans
- Built a CNN to detect four stages of Alzheimer's Disease from MRI images, applied oversampling, downsampling and augmentation to address inequalities in class sizes.
- https://github.com/grybkom/CNN_For_Alzheimers_Detection_MRI

## Characterization of Potassium Channels in Retinal Starburst Amacrine Cells
- Analysis of whole-cell electrophysiology recordings from starburst amacrine cells to gain insights about the role these cells play in visual processing. 
- https://github.com/grybkom/starburst_amacrine_cells_potassium_currents

## Models for Seizure Recognition from EEG Recordings
- Classification seizure activity from electroencephalogram recordings.
- https://github.com/grybkom/sezuire_recognition_eeg_recordings

## Comparison of Supervised Machine Learning Models for Stroke Prediction
- The results from Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoosted models were comared with and without implementing synthetic minority over-sampling technique to address class imbalance.
